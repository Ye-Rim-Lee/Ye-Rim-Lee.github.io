Hello!
I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Agricultural, Food, and Resource Economics](https://www.canr.msu.edu/afre/) at Michigan State University. My areas of interest are Energy Economics and Regional Economics. I received my Masters in Climate, Environment, and Energy Studies and B.A. in Economics from Sookmyung Women's University in Seoul, South Korea.

My first name is pronounced _Yeh-Reem_.

<!-- I am also enthusiastic about crochet, playing electric guitar and coding mobile productivity applications ðŸ˜Ž -->
